This solution requires the use of **Proxy servers**, either your own proxy servers or you can use [Apify Proxy](https://www.apify.com/docs/proxy).

##### Tip

When you want to have a scrape over a specific item URL, just copy and paste the link as one of the **startUrl**.

If you would like to scrape only the first page of a list then put the link for the page and have the `endPage` as 1.

With the last approach that explained above you can also fetch any interval of pages. If you provide the 5th page of a list and define the `endPage` parameter as 6 then you'll have the 5th and 6th pages only.

### Compute Unit Consumption

The actor optimized to run blazing fast and scrape many as items as possible. Therefore, it forefronts all item detail requests. If actor doesn't block very often it'll scrape 100 items in 1 minute with ~0.01-0.04 compute units.

### Allrecipes Advanced Scraper Input example

```json
{
  "startUrls":[
    "https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/onewholesomemeal",
    "https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/foodwisheswithchefjohn/collection/bookmarks_5e9f2dfb-c75b-8640-f3ff-7897a9ed3897",
    "https://www.allrecipes.com/search/results/?search=cucumber",
    "https://www.allrecipes.com/gallery/butter-rich-recipes/",
    "https://www.allrecipes.com/author/melanie-fincher/",
    "https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-clean-air-fryer/",
    "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/261911/chef-johns-croissants/"
  ],
  "proxy":{
    "useApifyProxy": true
  },
  "search": "cucumber",
  "includedKeywords":["salad"],
  "excludedKeywords":["onion"],
  "maxItems": 50,
  "endPage": 20
}

```

## During the Run

During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified.
When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.

## Allrecipes Export

During the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any languague (Python, PHP, Node JS/NPM). See the FAQ or <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/api" target="blank">our API reference</a> to learn more about getting results from this Allrecipes Advanced actor.

## Scraped Allrecipes Output

The structure of each item in Allrecipes looks like this:

If you've already put it to use, you know that these trendy kitchen gadgets allow you to still enjoy all your favorite fried foods with less fat and fewer calories. But you're still frying after all, which means you're going to have some grease to deal with afterward. The good news? It's an air fryer, so you're going to have way less greasy residue to clean than you would using a deep fryer. Learn how to clean your air fryer using items you likely already have on hand.    Tips for Cleaning Your Air Fryer  Before you deep clean your air fryer, learn the dos and don'ts of air fryer maintenance. Don't use metal utensils, abrasive sponges, or steel wire brushes to remove food particles and residue from your air fryer. This could damage the non-stick coating on the cooking surface.Don't submerge your air fryer in water. The main unit is an electric appliance, so this will damage it.Make sure your fryer is unplugged while you are cleaning.If you notice a foul odor coming from your air fryer, try cleaning the crevices with a wooden skewer, toothpick, or even an old toothbrush, to knock out stuck-on foods. These hidden crumbs can burn over time, causing the machine to smoke and smell.You can also cut half a lemon and rub the cooking surface and basket to help with residual odors. Let it sit for about 30 minutes before cleaning.Use food-safe cleaners. Avoid disinfectants that aren't approved for food contact.   How Often Should You Clean Your Air Fryer?   After Each Use  Each time you use your air fryer, wash the basket, tray, and pan with soap and warm water, or place them in the dishwasher. (Refer to the owner's manual to be sure these parts are dishwasher safe.) You should also quickly clean the interior using a damp cloth with a bit of dish soap over the area. Dry all the parts and reassemble.     After Every Few Uses  Though it's not necessary to take these steps after every use, washing the other main parts on occasion will keep your air fryer functioning properly. Use a damp cloth to wipe down the exterior every once in a while. You should also check the heating coil for oil or residue. If you notice some build-up there, wipe it with a damp cloth when the machine is cool.   How to Deep Clean an Air Fryer  If it's been a minute since you've given your air fryer a good clean, or you just don't know where to start, read on for our instructions on how to clean an air fryer from start to finish. Here's what you'll need:  Damp microfiber cloth or non-abrasive spongeDish soapBaking SodaSoft-bristle scrub brushClean, dry cloth Clean your air fryer by following a series of simple steps:  If you have just used it, start by unplugging your air fryer. Allow it to cool for about 30 minutes.Remove the baskets and pans, and wash with hot soapy water. If any of these parts have baked-on grease or food, allow the parts to soak in hot soapy water for at least 10 minutes before scrubbing with a non-abrasive sponge. Some of the parts may be dishwasher safe, so refer to your manual if you prefer to use the dishwasher to clean.Use a damp microfiber cloth or non-abrasive sponge with a bit of dish soap to wipe down the interior. Wipe away soap with a clean damp cloth.Turn the appliance upside down and use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe down the heating element.If there is any baked-on or hard residue on the main appliance, make a paste using water and baking soda. Scrub the paste into the residue using a soft-bristle scrub brush and wipe away with a clean cloth.Use a damp cloth to wipe down the exterior. Wipe away the soap with a clean damp cloth.Dry all removable parts and the main unit before reassembling.
